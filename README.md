# Line-tracking-robot
Dear,
This is arduino microcontroller based robot, here Infrared sensor was used to track/follow line. All the codes are available in .ino file formate. 
Have great day, 
Happy Learning.

01 ) File named "01_Sensor_1_Test.ino" was code to test working of an individual infrared sensor.
02) File named "02_Two_DC_Motor_Test.ino" was code to test working of an DC motor, code will test Two DC motors together, how ever you can test on as well.
03) File named "03_a_LineFollowing_2_Sensor.ino" was complete code of line tracking robot with two sensors.
04) File named "03_b_LineFollowing_3LinearSensor_BlackLine.ino" was complete code of line tracking robot with three sensors.
